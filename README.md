# First Tech Challenge Programming Simulator
This is a simulator for FTC Students to learn about basic programming logic.

*Currently in Beta development and this project is not yet complete. It is a very basic look at programming and is very helpful for people who are new to or learning programming of any kind*


## Functions:
There are currently 4 functions that one can use in the FTC Programming Simulator including:

**Drive Forward:**
```` 
driveForward(seconds,power);
````
*note: doesn't drive completely straight*

**Drive Backward:**
```` 
driveBackward(seconds,power);
````
*note: doesn't work properly as of now*

**Turn Left:**
```` 
turnLeft(seconds,power);
````
*note: will add turnForDegrees soon*

**Turn Right:**
```` 
turnRight(seconds,power);
````
*note: will add turnForDegrees soon*
